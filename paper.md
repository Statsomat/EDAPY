# Summary
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the first step performed in a classical statistical data analysis or machine learning model development. An EDA usually contains basic descriptive statistics and graphics of the dataset under investigation like means, variances, histograms or bar-plots. The Statsomat/EDAPY app is a web-based application for automated EDA with Python and created with the Shiny technology [@shiny] in combination with the R `reticulate` package [@reticulate]. The user uploads the data as a CSV file. By clicking a button a report is generated and finally downloaded as a PDF file containing the most important univariate EDA statistics and graphics. Moreover, the user can generate a file containing the Python code which can be used for learning or to reproduce results locally. The app was tested and validated by a pool of datasets. Outputs were compared to outputs generated by the R packages for EDA `pastecs` [@pastecs] and `psych` [@psych].  
The Statsomat/EDAPY app is hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and 
is one of several apps which can be accessed via the webpage of Statsomat \autoref{fig:statsomat} (see https://statsomat.com), 
a nonprofit company with the aim of developing, collecting and maintaining open-source apps for automated data analysis and
automated interpretation.

# Statement of need
The `pandas.DataFrame.describe` function is a function for simple and basic EDA in Python. On the other hand there are currently a number of Python packages for more complex and automated EDA: [dtale](https://pypi.org/project/dtale/), [pandas-profiling](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/index.html) or [sweetviz](https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/). We mention some of the main functionalities which are motivating the existance of the Statsomat/EDAPY app:  
- The usage directly in the browser (the generation of an EDA report downloadable as a PDF file without the need to access an IDE for Python) which is of interest for some applied researchers   
- The output generated by the Statsomat/EDAPY is much richer than `pandas.DataFrame.describe` but not so complex as the output delivered by some of the Python packages mentioned above (the complexity is for some data analysis cases not necessary and for some users overwhelming)   
- Compared to the Python packages mentioned above, the output of the Statsomat/EDAPY app is contained and delivered in one single file, the PDF report  
- Compared to some the Python packages mentioned above, the code to reproduce the EDA of the Statsomat/EDAPY app is contained and delivered in one single file and not per variable or procedure  
  
Finally, the Statsomat/EDAPY app is to the best of our knowledge one of the first open-source applications demonstrating the interaction between the components: Python, the R `reticulate` package, a Rmarkdown [@rmarkdown] document, all within a Shiny app hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Before uploading, the data must be prepared in the following way: Each row represents a record respectively an observation. Each column represents a variable respectively a parameter of interest. Do not store multiple variables in one column (for example sex and age in one column). Use distinct names for the columns. Empty cells indicate missing values. Other character values (e.g. "NA") are not recognized as missing values. Once you have your data prepared in the specified way, save it with the CSV format. If your data file is in an Excel or LibreOffice format, you can try to convert it to CSV by selecting "Save As". Try to select the format CSV with the character encoding UTF-8, this helps reading the data correctly. You can also prepare or inspect the CSV file with a text editor like 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/"><b>Notepad++</b></a>. You can also find <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/reyar/Statsomat-CSV-Datasets/"><b>here</b></a> some prepared CSV dataset examples to be used with the Statsomat apps. </p> 
<p>When your data is ready, you can proceed with the upload. A couple of upload properties must be specified. If you are not sure about them, you can choose the option "Auto" for each property. In this case, the
Statsomat app will try to identify automatically the right settings. In most of the cases, this will succeed. Otherwise, please consider alternative settings or data formats.</p>      
<p>After a successful upload of the data, you can proceed with the selection of the variables for the descriptive statistics. </p>
<p>Now you can generate and finally download the report. To make use of the table of contents, open the report with a PDF reader (for example Adobe Acrobat Reader). To seamlessly copy the R code, open the report in the browser. Further instructions are included in the report. </p>
